## The process

The codes were obtained using an old standard 3.5mm headphone connector with stripped wires 
connected directly to the TSOP output while pressing remote keys. The connector was plugged into the 
PC's microphone input and recorded using Audacity. The codes were then inspected manually and found to be  
Manchester encoded binary data. Some interesting key codes can be found in `decoding.txt` file.
